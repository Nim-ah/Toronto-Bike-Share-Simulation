# Toronto-Bike-Share-Simulation
Stochastic Optimization Simulation of Toronto Bike Share. Based on the paper "Simulation Optimization for a Large-Scale Bike-Sharing System" by Nanjing Jian, Daniel Freund, Holly M. Wiberg, and Shane G. Henderson. The paper describes the development and implementation of a simulation optimization framework for a large-scale bike-sharing system in New York City. The framework uses a simulation model to predict the system's performance under various scenarios and an optimization algorithm to identify the best decision policies for system operations.

The authors first describe the simulation model, which includes a network model of the city's streets and bike stations, a demand model based on historical trip data, and a bike redistribution model to ensure that bikes are available at stations where they are needed. They then discuss the optimization algorithm, which uses a combination of metaheuristic algorithms and local search methods to identify near-optimal decision policies for system operations.

The authors evaluate the framework using data from the New York City bike-sharing system and show that it is able to identify decision policies that significantly improve system performance, such as reducing customer wait times and increasing bike availability at popular stations. They also show that the framework is able to handle large-scale problems and can be used to evaluate the impact of different system configurations and policies.
